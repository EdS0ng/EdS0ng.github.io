&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi and welcome to my blog! As this is my first post, I just want to take the time to introduce myself and give some background. I recently finished my undergrad degree in Chemical Engineering earlier this year. I did not really enjoy my major, but decided to finish it anyways as switching majors would have cost me an extra year in college, and I just couldn't afford it. Thus, after graduation, I had a choice to make. I had to decide if I would go into chemical engineering and maybe switch out later, or just try and switch now. I knew I would much rather code for a living than work as a chemical engineer, and after talking to my friends and family, I decided that there was no reason for me to waste a few years doing something I did not enjoy. This brings me to now.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, I am at a coding bootcamp in the San Francisco Bay Area learning Javascript(and many of the frameworks that go with it) as well as HTML and CSS in order to become a fullstack web developer. In addition, I am learning Java and Android Studio when I have the time, as I am also very interested in mobile development. As mentioned in the blog description, I will mainly be talking about my journey to becoming a developer in this blog. Most of the posts will be about Javascript, with some on mobile development. I may also post a few things about coding bootcamps as I go through this process myself in an attempt to provide some information for those that are interested. Hopefully, there will be some information here that can help you. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will try to post something at least once a week, possibly more as time allows. Feel free to follow me on Twitter or email me with any questions. Thanks for reading!
